# Implementing-Gradient-Descent-from-Scratch
This repository is the code for implementing gradient descent from scratch

To learn what gradient descent is and how this piece of code works, you can check out an article I wrote on the same:
https://towardsdatascience.com/implementing-gradient-descent-in-python-from-scratch-760a8556c31f

The article goes through implementation on one dataset, while this repo has implementation on 2.

Attaching the IPYNB file as well as the data to this repository as well as the dataset.

Hope you have a good day!
